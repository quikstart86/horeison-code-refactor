## Installation

Cloned the repo from GitLab. I created a new repo on my local with the required starter files wich would then have to be refactored. I then pushed the new local repo to GitHub. During the work I would utilise 'git add, git commit, git push' to add all the changs to the remote repo (adding in commit comments to understand the changes). I then did a final test to make sure the code worked. Satisfied with the result I compiled a ReadME to log to all the steps.


## Usage 

-Created a new repo and pushed to GitHub
-Navigated to the repo using the CLI (gitbash)
-Created new files and folders within using 'mkdir' and 'touch'
-Opened the files in vs code using 'code .'
-Made edits to the files and then utlised 'git add -A, git commit -m " ", git push origin main' to update the remote repo
-I then created pages in GitHub to deploy the project to make it live : https://quikstart86.github.io/horeison-code-refactor/
